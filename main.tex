\abstract{The core-cusp problem is often seen as motivating the exploration of a wider variety of dark matter models. One such scenario is ULDM [ultra-light dark matter], which  proposes that dark matter consists of ultralight particles exhibiting wavelike properties on kiloparsec scales. ULDM obeys the Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson equation and has soliton-like solutions consisting of gravitationally bound condensates with no internal kinetic energy; however astrophysically realistic ULDM halos would  consist of a larger NFW-like configurations with a possible solitonic core. We describe a parameterisation for the radial density profiles of these scenarios which accounts for the environmental variability of realistic halos, and  compare these to ``synthetic'' ULDM halos generated by numerically colliding a number of individual solitons; this computationally efficient strategy precludes direct analysis of the evolutionary histories and interactions, but  allows us to create large numbers of prototype halos, with multiple realisations of these scenarios evolving towards broadly similar final states.
Utilising the SPARC database we show that ULDM does not necessarily exacerbate the core-cusp problem relative to standard CDM for a range of dwarf galaxies and a ULDM particle mass of $10^{-23}\operatorname{eV}$ yields a good fit to a subset of SPARC data.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

While it is widely agreed that non-baryonic dark matter constitutes the majority of the mass of the observable universe, its precise nature remains one of the most important open questions in fundamental physics. Many dark matter models have been proposed, with the WIMP model being the most widely studied. However, while this scenario successfully accounts for the large scale structure of the universe \cite{Springel:2005nw} and the spectrum of anisotropies in the microwave background \cite{deBernardis:2000sbo, Hanany:2000qf, Halverson:2001yy, Netterfield:2001yq, Lee:2001yp, Ade:2015xua,  Hu:2001bc}, the so-called ``small-scale crisis'' \cite{Weinberg:2013aya} remains a challenge. One key issue is the tension between the predicted central density profiles of dark matter halos in simulations containing only gravitationally interacting CDM [Cold Dark Matter] and those inferred from observational data as simulations tend to produce `cuspy' NFW-type central density profiles \cite{Navarro:1995iw}, which go like $1/r$ at small radii, while observational data appears to favour flattened central cores \cite{Moore:1994yx} . This so-called core-cusp problem has been the focus of much recent attention \cite{Dutton:2018nop, Read:2018pft, Genina:2018}. 

While the core-cusp problem may be ameliorated by adding baryonic matter to the simulations  \cite{Benitez-Llambay:2018}, there is considerable interest in alternative dark matter models in which central cusps cannot form.  One scenario which has gained substantial traction is ultra-light dark matter [ULDM], also known as scalar-field dark matter, $\Psi$ dark matter, axion dark matter, BEC dark matter and fuzzy dark matter. As reviewed by Hui {\em et al.\/} \cite{Hui:2016ltb}, ULDM consists of an axion-like particle whose very small mass  ($\mathcal{O}(\sim 10^{-22}eV)$) corresponds to a kiloparsec-scale de Broglie wavelength.  ULDM thus exhibits novel wave-like behaviour on astrophysically interesting scales and can form soliton-like gravitationally confined, Bose-Einstein condensates. ULDM simulations suggest that realistic astrophysical halos have an inner core consisting of a kiloparsec scale Bose-Einstein condensate or soliton, while the outer halo is a virialised system of scalar particles  matching expectations from CDM \cite{Schwabe:2016rze, Veltmaat:2018dfz}. The central regions of the solitonic solutions are relatively flat so it seems that ULDM could  resolve the CDM core-cusp problem without the inclusion of baryonic physics. 

Despite this apparent success, it has  been argued that in some mass regimes the density profiles predicted by ULDM actually exacerbate the core-cusp problem in comparison to the NFW profiles characteristic of WIMP CDM \cite{Robles:2018fur}. Indeed, as the inner regions of ULDM halos are described by solitonic density profiles, they are subject to the mass scaling laws of the ground-state soliton solutions. In particular these imply that as the mass contained within the central core increases, its radius decreases. For this reason, it is natural to expect that in the most massive cores, a large amount of mass is contained within a small radius. Hence, it is plausible that at small radii the internal mass of a heavy ULDM halo might exceed that of an `equivalent' NFW halo. The authors of \cite{Robles:2018fur} concluded that in comparison to observational data, the NFW profiles of CDM outperform ULDM profiles for dwarf galaxies with masses ($> M_h \sim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$). 

The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of variation in the core-halo mass scaling relation on ULDM halos. Accounting for the apparent scatter around the theoretical prediction of the core-halo mass ratio as implied in \cite{Schive:2014hza}, we find that the core-cusp problem is not necessarily exacerbated for ULDM relative to CDM at scales relevant to dwarf galaxies. Nevertheless,  neither ULDM halos (for ULDM particle mass $0.8-2.5\times 10^{-22} \operatorname{eV}$)
nor NFW halos provide a particularly good fit to astrophysical data in the SPARC database \cite{Lelli:2016zqa}. However, the SPARC database is not exhaustive, with data from some dwarf galaxies being limited to fewer than 5 data points and many of the profiles have significant uncertainties making it is difficult to draw strong conclusions. Furthermore, looking at numerical simulations we see that while the spherically-averaged density profiles of simulated ULDM halos follow a predictable format, the outer regions are highly turbulent, so that any individual point may vary widely from the global average.These uncertainties notwithstanding, we demonstrate a ULDM particle mass of $10^{-23}\operatorname{eV}$ can give a reasonable fit to a set of profiles from SPARC database can be obtained, with good agreement at small radii and this very small particle mass is in tension with some recent ULDM constraints.  \re{maybe a sentence or two about synthetic halos}

\section{Semi-analytic models of dark matter halos}

\subsection{The NFW profile of CDM}

We begin by looking at the semi-analytic parametrisations of ULDM and CDM halo models. The  NFW [Navarro-Frenk-White] profile of CDM \cite{Navarro:1995iw, Maccio:2008pcd}  is well known and given by
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nfw}
    \rho_{NFW}(r)=\frac{\rho_0}{\frac{r}{R_s}\left(1+\frac{r}{R_s}\right)^2}.
\end{equation}
%
where the parameters $\rho_0$ and $R_s$ \re{define physically} vary from halo to halo. By assumption, the profile is radially symmetric and it is well known that the corresponding volume integral for the mass would diverge as $r\rightarrow \infty$. In practice, however, the halo will have a finite size and this is typically set by the virial radius, which is approximately determined via the spherical top-hat collapse model \cite{White:2000jv, Suto:2015jdt, Herrera:2017epn} describing the collapse of a uniform spherical overdensity in a smooth expanding background. Collapse halts when virial equilibrium is reached, and the resulting virial radius is parametrised by $\Delta_c \rho_c(t)$ where $\rho_c(t)$ is the critical density of the universe at time $t$. It is found that the numerical factor $\Delta_c$ is of order $10^2$ and while different conventions exist we will take the common value of $\Delta_c = 200$ \cite{Richings:2018} in what follows. 

If we take the virial radius to define the  physical extent of the halo, equation \ref{eq:nfw} completely specifies the density profile for given  $\rho_0$ and $R_s$. Conversely, for any given virial mass, there is a range of  NFW density profiles but specific choices of $\rho_0$ and $R_s$ emerge from the mass-concentration-redshift relation evident in the results of N-body simulations \cite{Ludlow:2013vxa}. \re{or observation??}

\subsection{The piecewise ULDM halo profile}

ULDM dynamics is governed by the Schr{\"o}dinger-Poisson system of coupled differential equations which, in a static background, have the dimensionless form  
%
\begin{align}
    i\dot{\psi} &= -\frac{1}{2}\nabla^2\psi+\Phi\psi \\
    \nabla^2\Phi &= 4\pi \vert \psi\vert^2
\end{align}
%
where $\psi$ is the ULDM wavefunction, $\Phi$ is the Newtonian potential, and the density $\rho \propto |\psi|^2$. The solitonic profile must be found numerically, but  given a spherically symmetric  solution with $\psi(0)=1$ there is a one-parameter family of solutions such that
%
\begin{equation}
    \psi'(x) = \gamma\psi(\sqrt{\gamma}x)
\end{equation}
is also a solution.  Under this scaling, the dimensionless mass of the soliton is proportional to $\sqrt{\gamma}$, while the dimensionless radius is proportional to $1/\sqrt{\gamma}$. The dimensionless density $\vert\psi\vert^2$ and dimensionless radius $x$ can be transformed into dimensionful quantities by
\begin{align}
    \rho &= \mathcal{M}\mathcal{L}^{-3}\vert\psi\vert^2, \label{eq:density_conv} \\
    r &= \mathcal{L}x, \label{eq:mass_conv}
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eq:length}
    \mathcal{L}=\left(\frac{8\pi\hbar^2}{3 m^2H_0^2\Omega_{m_0}}\right)^{\frac{1}{4}}\approx121\left(\frac{10^{-23}\operatorname{eV}}{m}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}\operatorname{kpc}
\end{equation}
%
and 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mass}
    \mathcal{M}=\frac{1}{G}\left(\frac{8\pi}{3 H_0^2\Omega_{m_0}}\right)^{-\frac{1}{4}}\left(\frac{\hbar}{m}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\approx 7\times 10^7\left(\frac{10^{-23}\operatorname{eV}}{m}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}\operatorname{M}_{\odot}.
\end{equation}



Ref.~\cite{Robles:2018fur} gives the following piecewise parameterization of the generic ULDM profile 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:piecewise}
     \rho(r)=
    \begin{cases}
      \rho_{sol}(r), & 0\leq r \leq r_{\alpha} \\
      \rho_{NFW}(r), & r_{\alpha}\leq r \leq r_{vir},
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
%
where $\rho_{sol}(r)$ is the appropriately scaled density profile of the ground state soliton solution. 
To construct the ULDM halo profile in accordance with \ref{eq:piecewise}, we must determine the predicted central density, $\rho_c$ of a ULDM halo for a given virial mass, $M_{vir}$. In \cite{Robles:2018fur}, this is done by making use of the core-halo mass relation found by the authors of \cite{Schive:2014hza} from numerical simulations. In particular, we have that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:central_dens}
    \rho_c = 2.94*10^6 \operatorname{M}_{\odot}\operatorname{kpc}^{-3}\left(\frac{M_{vir}}{10^9 M_{\odot}}\right)^{4/3}m_{22}^{2}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
    r_c = 1.6 \operatorname{kpc}\left(\frac{M_{vir}}{10^9 M_{\odot}}\right)^{-1/3}\frac{1}{m_{22}},
\end{equation}
where $r_c$ is the radius at which the density drops to half its central value, and $m_{22}$ is defined as $m_{22} \equiv m / 10^{-22} \operatorname{eV}$. Here $m$ is the ULDM particle mass. 

While this precise scaling relation gives us a baseline prediction for the central density of a ULDM halo of a given virial mass, for a given halo mass we expect that there will be a range of acceptable central densities, in analogy with the scatter in the concentration parameter of NFW profiles \cite{Maccio:2008pcd}  Indeed, inspection of the results of \cite{Schive:2014hza} indicates a scatter of up to $\pm 50\%$ from the  predicted value of the core mass, $M_c$, the mass contained within  within $r_c$. The small sample size and limited halo mass range ($ M_{vir} \approx 10^8-10^{11} \operatorname{M}_{\odot}$)  of the data in Ref.~\cite{Schive:2014hza} means it is probably not meaningful to use it to specify a detailed distribution but we will assume a scatter of $\pm 50\%$, with the caveat that data from future simulations could lead to improved statistics.

Moreover, as acknowledged in \cite{Robles:2018fur}, we expect to see variation in both the central soliton density and the radius at which the solitonic profile of the ULDM halo transitions into an NFW profile. This variation is captured by the parameter $\alpha$, such that the transition radius, $r_{\alpha}$, is given by $r_{\alpha} = \alpha r_c$, where $3 \leq \alpha \leq 4$.  With the allowances for statistical variation in both the central soliton density and the transition radius taken into account, we can now create a range of acceptable ULDM halo profiles for a given halo virial mass. To do this, we use the virial mass to predict $\rho_c$. Combined with an assumption for $\alpha$, the solitonic piece of the ULDM profile is then completely specified, and its mass can be calculated. From here, we can calculate the mass in the the NFW tail of the ULDM profile andm by matching the densities of the NFW tail and the inner soliton at the transition radius, as the values of the $R_s$ and $rho_0$ parameters of the ULDM profile NFW tail are fully constrained.  

\re{Some quick questions -- not sure if we want to answer them all 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Do we actually caclulate (or point to someone who does) the mass fraction in the tail as opposed to the solition, as a function of mass?? 
\item We should write down the final piecewise form showing all the various parameters, up to the shape of the soliton which we don't have analytically, since that is likely to be useful to other people. 
\item also -- in principle, can the ULDM profile turn over to $1/r$ before becoming solitonic; presumably if the particle mass is big enough?  Not necessarily astrophysically reasonable, but must be true in principle. 
\end{itemize}

\re{think this works better coming first, since it relates directly to the ULDM profile. I think that makes for better flow -- since it will go from here to the comparison between the profiles, and from there to comparisons with data}

Halo formation in the ULDM model has been investigated by a number of studies \cite{Schwabe:2016rze, Mocz:2017wlg, Lin:2018whl} which suggest that a generic ULDM halo consists of a solitonic core surrounded by a turbulent outer halo whose density profile falls off like $1/r^3$, as described in the previous Section. Full astrophysical structure formation simulations in ULDM are particularly challenging, given the need to effectively resolve a wide range of scales in an expanding background. However, we can produce ``synthetic'' halos by setting initial conditions in a Schr{\"o}dinger-Poisson  solver corresponding to ${\cal{O}}(10)$ randomly located solitons, allowing them to merge and running the simulation long enough to arrive at a stable ``final'' state. 

We  implemented this approach in {\sc PyUltraLight}  \cite{Edwards:2018ccc}, and the results of one such simulation are shown in Figure \ref{fig:pul}. This profile was obtained through the merger of eight randomly positioned solitons whose masses were selected from a Gaussian distribution centred at 5000 code units. \re{what width?} The simulation was run at $512^3$ for a duration of 0.05 code units, while the volume of the simulation region, also in code units, was $0.2^3$. \re{maybe explain -- this is the size of the box; what region of the simulation volume were the solitions inside} For ULDM  mass of $10^{-22}\operatorname{eV}$, this choice corresponds to individual progenitor masses of $\sim 1.1*10^{10}\operatorname{M}_{\odot}$, duration $\sim 3.8 \operatorname{Gyr}$, and side length $\sim 7.7 \operatorname{kpc}$. 

The density profile of the resulting merger product is found to be qualitatively similar for larger/smaller masses \re{ particle masses? initial solition mass?}, though the size of the solitonic core is subject to the inverse mass-radius scaling relation of the ground-state solution to the Schr{\"o}dinger-Poisson equations. After the solitons collide, some material is ejected from the central region; {\sc PyUltraLight} was modified to include a sponge at the simulation boundary so this material does not  reenter the from the opposite side as a result of the periodic boundary conditions, so mass is not globally conserved. The simulation was run for long enough so that that the mass-loss rate asymptotically approaches zero well before the end of the simulation, giving confidence that the resulting halo represents a relaxed merger product. 

The left panel of Figure \ref{fig:pul} demonstrates the spherically-averaged density profile of the relaxed merger product over time. The inner region is solitonic, transitioning to a $1/r^3$ type profile at a distance of between 3 and 4 times the core radius. We see that while there is some weak time-dependence in the overall profile, it is largely stable. However, the right side panel demonstrates significant local fluctuations in the density of the outer halo along any individual arbitrary direction as function of time.  \re{do we know how these compare to NFW halos in simulations? And how much they depend on our initial state -- not the detailed form, but the size of the fluctuations?  And also what the local changes in the effective gravitational force would be a result of them? Has this been looked at elsewhere?? Not suggesting we did too far here and they are potentally a function of our ``synthetic'' approach, but potentially kind of interesting?}

\re{this material below  is redundant with stuff above?} 

{\em In order to explicitly demonstrate the applicability of the piece-wise method for constructing generic ULDM halos developed in \cite{Robles:2018fur} and described in Section \ref{eq:piecewise}, we run an arbitrary merger simulation in PyUltraLight and contrast the resulting density profile with the synthetic piecewise profile. The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:validity}. Here, 8 arbitrarily positioned solitons with masses selected from a Gaussian distribution centred at 50000 code units merge to form a single halo, which is given sufficient time to relax (asymptotically approaching sero mass loss). Again, a sponge is implemented at the boundary of the simulation volume so that ejected matter does not artificially increase the mass of the inner halo. A piecewise profile is then constructed, ensuring that the central density matches that of the simulation output. The virial mass is then calculated according to \ref{eq:central_dens} and the overall profile constructed. Choosing the transition radius as $3.8r_c$ yields a good fit to the simulation data. This is  shown in Figure \ref{fig:validity}.}

\re{Do we want to see a couple of additional plots for different initial implementations? Also, we could possibly show a plot of the initial state. AND if they inhomogeneities are interesting, a plot showing a slice through the centre of the relaxed halo, showing the local density; maybe as a contour plot?}

Green lines represent  ULDM profiles with $\operatorname{M}_c = \operatorname{M}_{cp} \pm 50 \% \operatorname{M}_{cp}$.}\label{fig:profiles}
\end{figure}

 
Using formalism developed here we compare the radial profiles of ULDM halo profiles to NFW profiles. We focus on masses in the range $10^{11}$ and $10^{12} \operatorname{M}_{\odot}$ since these cases showed an apparent worsening of the core-cusp problem in Ref.~\cite{Robles:2018fur}. \re{ this is right?} Figure \ref{fig:profiles} shows comparisons for representative masses; the green lines represent the ULDM density profiles at the extreme ends of the $\operatorname{M}_c = \operatorname{M}_{cp} \pm 50 \% \operatorname{M}_{cp}$ range, where $\operatorname{M}_{cp}$ is the theoretical predicition for the core mass. Thanks to the scaling relations obeyed by the Schr{\"o}dinger-Poisson soliton solution, this mass range corresponds to a range of $ \gamma_p /4 \geq \gamma \leq 9\gamma_p/4$, where $\gamma_p$ is the theoretical prediction of the square root of the dimensionless central density, yielding a large variation in the central density and widely varying predictions for the overall ULDM profiles. Meanwhile  1-$\sigma$ and 2-$\sigma$ ranges for NFW profiles with different concentrations are show as red and blue dots, respectively \cite{Maccio:2008pcd}. 

Following Ref~\cite{Robles:2018fur}, we plot to a minimum radius of $r/r_{vir} = 10^{-4}$ and for the same choices of $m_{22}$. We note in passing that for any $\operatorname{M}_{vir}$, the NFW halo density at small radii will inevitably exceed that of the ULDM halo, though the threshold for this transition may be arbitrarily small, and not relevant observationally.  From Figure \ref{fig:profiles} we see that for halo masses of $10^{11}\operatorname{M}_{\odot}$ there is a wide range of $M_c$ for which the ULDM profile is less cuspy than its NFW counterpart.  For a halo mass of $10^{12}\operatorname{M}_{\odot}$ and a ULDM particle mass $m_{22}=0.8$ the ULDM profiles are likewise less peaked than the corresponding NFW profile, but at higher particle mass ($m_{22}=2.5$) the  NFW profiles tend to be less peaked than corresponding ULDM profiles at radial distances in  the range $10^{-4}\leq r/r_{vir} \leq 1$.


\section{Comparison of velocity distributions to SPARC data}

It is not the dark matter halo density profiles themselves which are directly  through astrophysical observations, rather it is the radial velocity distributions of tracer stars. We convert density profiles to radial velocity distributions \cite{Sofue:2008wt} via 
%
\begin{equation}
    V(r)^2 = \frac{4\pi G}{r}\int_0^r \rho(r')r'^2 dr',
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}
    V^2 = V_{disk}^2 + V_{bulge}^2 + V_{gas}^2 + V_{halo}^2.
\end{equation}
%

\re{intro SPARC in a sentence or two}
The disk and bulge velocities in the SPARC database are given for $\Upsilon = 1 \operatorname{M}_{\odot}/\operatorname{L}_{\odot}$ at $3.6\operatorname{\mu m}$. However, the greatest source of uncertainty in mass modelling is the assumption for the stellar mass-to-light ratio, $\Upsilon_\star$ \cite{Lelli:2016zqa}. As in \cite{Robles:2018fur}, we  assume a constant value of $\Upsilon_\star = 0.2 \operatorname{M}_{\odot}/\operatorname{L}_{\odot}$ at $3.6\operatorname{\mu m}$, noting that  this constitutes a non-trivial source of uncertainty in the results. Moreover, there is significant uncertainty in the SPARC data itself, though the error bars are not plotted in the following graphs for ease of viewing.

Results are shown for ULDM particle mass $m_{22} = 0.8$ (left) and $m_{22} = 2.5 $ (right). \re{I actually feel like the 2.5 is better than the 0.8, whereas later we argue for 0.1?} }\label{fig:velocity_11}
\end{figure}


The SPARC database contains photometric data for 175 galaxies, with maximum velocities spanning a range of over $200 \operatorname{kms}^{-1}$. For comparison to the theoretical velocity profiles of the $10^{11}\operatorname{M}_{\odot}$ halos, we have chosen only those candidates with maximum velocity $< 1.2\times 10^2 \operatorname{kms}^{-1}$ and our results are shown in Figures \ref{fig:velocity_11} and \ref{fig:velocity_12}. From Figure 2 \re{hard coded number}, we see that for $10^{11}\operatorname{M}_{\odot}$  neither  NFW nor  ULDM profiles for appear to show good agreement with the data. While the core-cusp problem is not necessarily exacerbated in the ULDM case, ULDM profiles which roughly fit the data at low radii fall short at larger radii. This problem is worse at larger values of $\alpha$. That said, the proportion of baryonic matter is largest at the centre, so it is in this region that inaccuracies in the assumptions of the stellar mass to light ratio will be most critical.  For this reason it is difficult to determine with certainty which model, if either, is a better fit to the data.

While the SPARC database does not contain any cases for which the velocity is significantly below $10^2\operatorname{kms}^{-1}$ at $10 \operatorname{kpc}$, it would appear that the ULDM profiles for the $10^{11}\operatorname{M}_{\odot}$ halos may provide a better fit to data in a lower velocity regime at this radius.  In Figure \ref{fig:velocity_12}, we show the comparison of the theoretical profiles for the $10^{11}\operatorname{M}_{\odot}$ halos with SPARC data satisfying $1.55 \operatorname{kms}^{-1}\leq V_{max}\leq 2.0 \operatorname{kms}^{-1}$.

As for the $10^{11}\operatorname{M}_{\odot}$ case, neither the ULDM nor the NFW profiles appear to provide a particularly convincing fit to the data. In saying this, it must be recognised that there is significant variation in the trends in the data itself, so it would be difficult to find a universally applicable profile. Interestingly, however, there are a number of galaxies in this sample set which have flatter velocity profiles within the plotted range, such as NGC6946, UGC02916, and UGC08699. For these cases, the ULDM profile appears to provide a better fit, however more observational data would be required to confirm this. 

While the ULDM profiles predicted for $10^{11}$ and $10^{12} \operatorname{M}_{\odot}$ halos at $m_{22} = 0.8 - 2.5$ do not provide convincing fits to  the SPARC data, it is interesting to consider models with a slightly lower ULDM particle mass. In particular, if we consider $m_{22} = 0.1$, corresponding to $m = 10^{-23} \operatorname{eV}$, we find a much improved fit to the data. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:velocity_23}. It should be noted, however, that a ULDM particle mass of this magnitude is in tension with constraints from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest \cite{Amendola:2005ad}, as well as high-redshift UV luminosity function comparisons \cite{Bozek:2014uqa}.

\section{Conclusions}

While the ULDM model has gained popularity as a means by which to resolve the contentious core-cusp problem of CDM, there exist cases in which theoretical ULDM profiles have higher densities than their NFW counterparts at observationally relevant radii in the interior of massive dwarf galaxies. However, given the apparent spread in the predicted ULDM core-halo mass relation \cite{Schive:2014hza}, there exists a significant range of plausible central densities for a halo of any given mass. In some circumstances this can mitigate the apparent core-cusp discrepancy. 

Comparison of theoretical ULDM and NFW profiles to photometric data from the SPARC database yields inconclusive results, as neither ULDM nor NFW profiles provide a particularly good fit to the data in the ranges $10^{11}\operatorname{M}_{\odot}\leq \operatorname{M}_{vir} \leq 10^{12}\operatorname{M}_{\odot}$ and $0.8 \leq m_{22} \leq 2.5$. Interestingly, however, a better fit to the lower velocity SPARC data is obtained from a ULDM profile where $m_{22} = 0.1$ and $\operatorname{M}_{vir} = 5\times 10^{11}\operatorname{M}_{\odot}$. While this ULDM particle mass appears to be in tension with current constraints \cite{Amendola:2005ad, Bozek:2014uqa}, a number of differing constraints on the ULDM particle mass have been proposed, with a lack of universal consensus \cite{Armengaud:2017nkf}.

It is clear that more data, both from simulations and astrophysical observations, is required to fully explore the applicability of the ULDM model of dark matter. A larger volume of photometric data with improved uncertainties and covering a greater halo mass range would be of tremendous benefit. Indeed, it is reasonable to expect a vast amount of new data becoming available in the near future, as a number of extensive surveys are undertaken \cite{Simon:2019kmm}. In addition, cosmological structure formation simulations for ULDM models continue to be an active area of research \cite{Lin:2018whl, Clough:2018exo, Mocz:2015sda}, and we can expect an improvement on the statistics surrounding the core-halo mass-redshift relation in future. Thus, while this preliminary work is somewhat inconclusive, it motivates further analyses of this kind in future as available datasets advance.
